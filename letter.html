    <h1 class="fixed_heading">Hi Lasya,</h1>
  <div class="container" id="letter-container">
    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">10-15-2025/22</h3>
    <h3 >The day you fell in love with me.</h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Well how do I begin? I think I know exactly how to begin, I'm beginning exactly as you did in the letter you gave me. I know this is not a letter, and I wish I could give you one as you did for me, but I can't for obvious reasons. Making you a website was the next best thing I could think of, so here it is - I hope you like it. It's really late at night (like 2am) and all I can think about is how different things could have been. All I can think about is how that day must have felt for you - scared, overwhelmed and tired; and how it must have been so hard to hold on to what you felt for me. Sometimes I wonder if that day would've been different if we weren't so overwhelmed and tired. And I want to say that I understand, <p>I understand everything and I don't blame you</p>. I'm not mad. I definitely don't hate you. I'm sorry that a lot of it was my fault too. I'm sorry I let my own pain, my own insecurities, slip into our relationship. I'm sorry that i demanded too much of you. I'm sorry that I kept crossing the limit and I regret it so much. I'm sorry we argued the way we did.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>But I want you to know I've changed, not only to be a better boyfriend, but to be a better person as well. I've grown and I've learnt a lot. And I'm ready to love you better.
    </h3>
        <br>
    <h3>You told me in the letter, that sometimes you wish you never met me so I could be happy with someone else. But the truth is Lasya, I would've never been happy with anyone else - because you are the reason I know I can be so happy. You told me: "you deserve someone who will give you the happiness you deserve", but you fail to realise that <p>you</p> are that person. Nothing diminishes how much happiness you've brought me. I realise that I've never been truly happy before you. I realise that you are the only person that can bring me that sort of happiness. I love you, I love you, I love you. How I want to scream it out loud right now, how I want to say it to you with eyes full of longing and love. I don't want my to be for someone new, its for <p>Lasya</p>. My days were so happy with you, so full of life and energy. Just knowing you were there made me feel better. Just knowing that despite everything, I had my Lasya. I dont want an easier version of love - I want <p>my</p> love with <p>you</p>. The love where we cried and laughed, fought and made up, lost our way and found each other again. That space in my heart is always yours. My love for you is as deep as the pacific ocean. I hope I made you feel like that too. And even if I knew everything that I do today, how everything turned out - <p>I'd still choose you a thousand times over.</p></h3>
        <br>
    <h3>I'm so sorry for making you exhausted. And I also don't know if by the time I send you this message, what love you had buried, faded away or not.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>You deserve the world, the moon, the stars, <p>THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE</p>, and I'm sorry that at times I didn't make you feel like that. But I really do believe that, and I love you for the everything you are, for the amazing person you are. I still hope to give you everything you deserve, but I don't know if it's too late.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>I just hope that one day you find it in yourself to rediscover that love you had - so you know, we could buy a ship and find the One Piece while singing Akuma No Ko. We could also, you know, buy a home together in Germany, and have you wear my shirt while sitting on the kitchen countertop, watching me cook. We could also, you know, talk in our silly little language and call each other meanies. We could also, you know, hold each other like we used to, you giving me the head scratchy that I love so much and me rubbing your back. We could also, you know, still dance in the rain, blast music during night drives in our car, still explore the world together. And it's not the only the grand adventures - we could also, you know, argue over the perfect spot on the sofa. We could alos, you know, fight for the side of the bed iwth the charging point; negotiate over who cooks and who does the dishes - or we decide to both do it together. Where you wrap your arms around me from behind while I cook. Where we eat ice cream straight from the tub. Where we eat together, playing with each other's feet under the table; where we curl up on the sofa, lost in a movie - but more lost in each other. Where we fall asleep, tangled in each other's arms. Where we leave for work together; where fight and make up within minutes; where we laugh and giggle on the balcony, wrapped in a blanket and looking at the moon - kissing each other. Its kind of funny, we always wanted to take a Polaroid of us together but it was impossible to get one; and now I have one - <p>but it's you that's missing</p>.</h3>
        <br>
      <h3>Even though it would be just the two of us, I would be so happy because you make the darkest of days joyful. I loved every single moment we spent, all our texting, calling, voice messages, sending pictures and the very few dates we did share were the happiest days of my life. The 2 years we spent together will always be the happiest days of my life.</h3>
    <h3>(P.S - the moon is still beautiful, but I'd stare at you even under a moonlit sky full of stars and galaxies. Something I have said to you, and something that I still mean. CRINGE CRINGE CRINGE (like you said), but after everything we've done and said, thats the least cringe thing ever.)</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>Those 2 years were the <p>happiest</p> of my life. I never knew I could be so happy, love someone so deeply and give everything I have to love them, before you. You took my heart and you didn't just hold it gently, you nourished it, cared for it and shaped it into something much better - something capable of loving another person with its <p>entire</p> being. I think sometimes, what did I do to deserve someone so <p>amazing</p>? How can I ever pay it back? And I'm sorry that at times, I didn't understand that or lost sight of it; but that is what you are: the most amazing person ever. In your letter you mentioned every little thing I did for you, and how you loved it. At the time, the list wasn't long. But now, after everything we've done and said, that list requires an entire book. I love how you hug me, I love how you kiss me, I love how you hold me and give me those head scratches. I love all your random I love you's, all your spamming of "baby", every goognite handsome, every allo, every hubby, every darling and every reel you've ever sent me. I still have all your reels saved and your cute messages forwarded. I still look at your photos and kiss them and wonder what I did to get such a gorgeous, breathtaking girl. You said in your letter that your memory sucked, but that you remembered everything we did. And even though my memory doesn't suck and so it might not hold the same weight as you remembering, I still remember every little thing and every little detail about you, and how much I love and cherish it. I remember how you used to cry to watching that YouTube video my mother made, and you called me <p>precious</p> every single time. I remember every single promise we made, every dumb phase we had, I remember all the silly words we said.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>You are not hard to love. Loving you is the <p>easiest</p> thing in this world that I have ever done. It's as if I was <p>made</p> to do it. My heart is so <p>full</p> of it - one look at you and it's all I can feel. Pure, uncondtional love. I it is not hard to love you - <p>it is impossible not to.</p>As long as I'm alive, you'll always have someone who is proud of you.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3><p>You have a hold on my heart that I could not break even if I wanted to. It has been overwhelming, and humbling at times. But I could not stop loving you anymore than I could stop <b id="breathing">breathing</b>. I am hopelessly, irretrievably in love with you; more than you'll ever know. You complete me, Lasya.</p></h3>
        <br>
    <h3>Thank you so much for being a part of my life <p>(the most important one)</p>. You weren't just someone I held close to my heart, you're literally a part of it, <p>woven into my heartstrings.</p> Thank you for everything you did, every small thing and every grand gesture. Thank you for making me feel important, and thank you for making me feel loved and cared for. Thank you for loving me. I might be too late now, but - <p>I LOVE YOU LASYA.</p> I always did, and I always will love you. I'm grateful that I've known the feeling of loving a woman, a woman who I could be <p>completely vulnerable</p> with -  who I could bare my soul to without fear. A woman who makes me feel like <p>God put an angel on Earth just for me.</p> I'm so grateful that I could love a person whose eyes could level me, steady me, break me, heal me - all at once. A woman who could rescue me from the deepest pits of hell with a single glance. I'm so grateful that I could love a woman whose touch, whose embrace, could pull me from the darkest abyss and stitch together every broken part of me. <p>I'd give up forever to touch you.</p> I love all those little idiosyncrasies, because they're what make you so special. I'm so grateful that our love was something that most people search their entire lives for, and I'm so grateful that that was our <p>reality.</p></h3>
        <br>
    <h3><p>Your arms are the closest to home I've ever known, your gaze and smile are the closest to heaven I've ever felt, and your face is the closest to perfection I've ever seen.</p></h3>
        <br>
    <h3>(P.S part 2 - I said it every chance I got, and your eyes are still the most gorgeous thing in the entire universe. They sparkle and glitter even in the darkest of rooms. Octane company didn't lie when they say the ink don't smudge.)</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>Do you remember that quote? <p>"One day, if you find yourself in a position to fall in love again, fall in love with me."</p> Yes, I would do that, but how will I love you <p>AGAIN</p> if I never fell <p>OUT</p> of love with you? I don't know what you think of me as of now; but know that I have never blamed you for what you felt that day and I never will. I want you to know that everything I ever said to you, everything I'm typing now, I mean all of it. I'm scared - no - I <p>accept</p> that I will love you forever even if I were to love someone else. I can never love them whole-heartedly; there will always be a part of me that still loves you - always. I don't know what will happen, but if you ever feel guilty about what you felt, don't. I won't say it didn't hurt me - it did - but I will never blame you for it. And no matter what, <p>I would choose you everyday for the rest of my life.</p> I miss you everyday, and I think about all the promises we made, all the moments we shared, and the life we could have lived together.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>I think I know exactly how you felt all the way back when we were separated for the first time, when you wrote the letter I'm basing this on. I remember looking through your account and finding all the reels you sent to yourself about still loving me and still wanting to be with me, I remember all your texts to Mridula about still wanting to be together. And that is <p>exactly</p> me right now. I look at everything you gave, the anklet and plushie I still have to give, the kisses on my jersey and sweater; and I remember all the things you still have to give too, and it reminds me so much of you. I still hope you can give me that painting of Hello Kitty and Spiderman kissing, the page with your kisses on it, your hotwheels, your valentine's day gift, and the other things you made; I still hope you can wear the bracelet I gave you every night again. Your paper flowers and little paper pirate ship still sit in the glass cabinet in front of my bed, and I still look at it every night before I switch the lights off.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>Words can't describe how <p>scared</p> I am of reaching out to you, but I think you know what I'm feeling - because you were in my place too once. I'm so scared right now, but I'd never forgive myself if I didn't do everything to try and live my life with you again, together. I'd always regret it. So here I am, pouring my heart out to you, even though I'm as scared as can be. <p>Because my love for you is more important than my fear, more important than my pride, more important than anything</p>. Because I miss you more than you could know. I've wanted to show you this as soon as I made it, but I know that I had to give you space, and that has been the hardest part - to just wait, missing you everyday without being able to do anything.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>Im basing this message on your letter, not because I can't make my own, but in the hopes that maybe you can relate to it more. I have said everything I could and I have done everything I can, it is your decision now. If you don't want to, this is the last time I will reach out to you; but know that despite that, <p>you will always have a home, a safe place where you can be without judgement.</p> I hope you find it in yourself - like I did all that time ago - if even one tiny part of you still wants to pursue our life together, <p>then my heart will always leave the door open for you.</p> I think everything you felt then, when you wrote this letter, I feel exactly the same now - every last part. And if you're scared, don't be, because I'm here for you, without even the tiniest bit of judgement, <p>no matter what.</p> I think the universe is telling me it's my turn: my turn to reach out and call you back home, no matter how scared I am; just like you did back then. So I ask you: <p>come back - come back home, Lasya</p>. I was home for you once, and I can still be that same home.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3>Like I said before, your arms are the closest to home I've ever known, your gaze and smile are the closest to heaven I've ever felt, and you are the closest to perfection there exists.</h3>
        <br>
    <h3><p>I love you I love you I love you I love you to the moon and back (and so much more).</p>Thank you for being the reason I exist, thank you for being the reason that I can love you the way I do.</h3>
      <br>
    <h3 id="jetaime">Je t'aime. Aujourd'hui. Ce soir. Demain. Pour toujours. Si je vivais mille ans, je t'apparti-endrais pour tous. Si je vivais mille vies, je te ferais mienne dans chacune d'elles.</h3>

        <br>
    <h3>(P.S part 3 - Miraculous is great, I'm watching it and I should've when you told me to. Also also Barca won the Copa Del Rey against vardrid, and maybe by the time I send this to you, they'll win the UCL and La Liga too all because of my pookie yamal and pedri)</h3>
        <br>
    <h4>(P.S part 4 - Spent three hours building this page, and almost eight fixing every little bug - just for this one page, out of the six that exist. But I would've spent forever if it meant making you smile - or cry tears of joy ;))</h4>
