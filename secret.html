      <h3 class="poem">Bring her back to me, not as memory, not as a whisper carried by the wind, but as the pulse I once felt beneath my trembling hands. Let her laughter echo in the hollow chambers of this lifeless home, filling it once more with the music of her being. The world moves on, indifferent to the fracture within me, but I remain here, rooted to the spot where she last stood, my soul a silent plea to the universe. Her absence is a wound that refuses to heal, a shadow that stretches endlessly. I would trade every sunrise, surrender every dream, just to feel the weight of her gaze again. Bring her back to me, not as a ghost or a fleeting dream, but as the warmth I've lost, as the heartbeat that once tethered me to life itself.</h3>

        <h3>I played good after so long today 😭 I had so many sexy plays and passes ukkkk. It was so fucking fun too. I didn't play as good as I used to but I still played much better than I was I feel like I'm coming back into form. There was uhhh vedanth slave, timmy, baldy, adi, duddu, nerd and his brother, dhruv and that mithil lund fellow came after so long. Ay uk how much garv and timmy annoyed me they barely pass properly and all they do is shoot like they're ronaldo and they'll score from wherever and however they want 😭 I had better ball control and my through balls were sexy. There was this one play where I cut past nerd and shot with left leg barely even looking at the goal and it went. We beg on the last game saying whoever lost had to pay for next turf 🤓. It was swargarani fc vs apartment fc. I joined skool wala team and adi called me traitor and said he hated me ☹️. So fucking fun it was we shoukd bet on games again so ppl akshually play properly.

They scared him so much the ref didn't give us 2 pens during the game and they cry about one unfair foul he called 😭🙏 yamal sexy nigga gave 2 assists. Pedri scored ferran my nigga scored in the last 10 minutes to equalise. I remember nerd crying that they won before he scored that goal.

We lost our chance to win the ucl this time also. I just wish you were to tell me it was okay that there's still next year. I like to believe that you know about the match by some post or something and that you saw the score at the end and you thought about me when you did. You probably didn't see it, but I'll like to believe it. I wanted to tell you how happy I'd be if we went to the finals. Always next time, right baby? Visca barca Visca catalunya 😛😛😛😛.

Whatever I'm feeling, I saw that smile in your eepover story - and that smile is still the most beautiful thing ever. That curve near your lips will always be something I remember. I'd recognize your smile in an instant out of a thousand people, and how can I not? - it's engraved into my brain. The truth is baby, I don't know anything - and that is the hardest part. That is the part that cuts deepest. <p>I don't know.</p> But I do know this: <p>I love you and I always will. I choose you and I always will.</p> Im just scared. I just want you to hold me, because the world is a heavy for me right now; I want the peace that follows from your words.

I love you to the moon and back and so much more. I see you as if you are made of light, not flesh - but something as pure and unfiltered as light. I <p>saw</p> you, I still see you.

        <h3>I want to know you forever. I want to know every scar you have, every stretch mark. I want to know every new wound that's healing and every new pimple and mosquito bite.

        <h3>"That lil long relationship you seen me in was just a prank (please just forget about it)". You liked that reel. I didn't know what to feel. I don't know what you felt when you liked that. Maybe it was just a moment, maybe it was your way of coping. But it felt like a slap on the face, like everything we had was being laughed off. I almost stopped making this. But then I remembered everything we had, everything we shared - and I realised I still believe in that. I <p>know</p> I love you. And I still choose you. The world is telling me to move on, that it wasn't my fault. But I don't care. I'm not waiting and believing because I'm stuck. Not because I'm afraid of moving on - but because <p>I love you.</p> I can't hate you - how could I? I don't know what you're going through, what you're feeling. I know you've been hurting too - in your own way. Maybe you needed to shut it all out to protect yourself. Just know that I never turned cold on you. I was hurt, confused at times - yes. But bitter? Never. I love you, Lasya. I love you so much. I still love you in the quietest, loudest and deepest way, even if it's just me right now. I won't let a few reels erase two years of love. I'm sorry if that was harsh. I just needed you to know. <p>I love you. I still choose you.</p></h3>
        <br>
        <h3><p>I still choose you.</p> Even now—when it's quiet, when you're far away, when the world tells me to move on—I don't. Because this love? It wasn't built on convenience. It was built on stolen glances in classrooms, on soft smiles during rain, on whispered dreams, and on days we didn't even realize we were falling. I know we never got all the time we deserved. We never got the dates that stretched into sunsets, or the lazy Sundays tangled in warmth, or the quiet midnight calls where words weren't even needed. But even without all that, you are still my person. I'm not holding on to a memory—I'm holding on to us. To the way you made the world make sense. To the way your laughter made my heart rest. To the way I never had to be anyone else when I was with you. I'm not giving up. Not because I'm stuck. But because I believe. In you. In me. In everything we could still become. I'll wait. Not because I have to. But because no one else is you.</h3>

        <h3>I was going to record the songs for you to put into the later pages. oh no spoilers 😛. But I'm tired right now. I'm so tired from the thousands of lines of code. I'll do it later, I know my dumbass is going to rerecord it 1000 times. I hope you like everything I made for you. I hope it reaches you.</h3>

        <h3>Is this how you felt those 10 months we weren't together? Did you stay up every night and just miss me with everything you had? Did you ask the universe the same questions I'm asking now? Did you keep envisioning the moment about what I'd say if you asked for that second chance? Did you continue imagining our life together? Did you keep saving and sending reels about us? Did you see every little thing as some sort of sign from the universe - even though deep down, you know you didnt believe in "signs"? You chose to love me through hurt then, and I'm doing it for you now. Kinda funny how it comes full circle. How did you keep all that in for so long? Here I am - dreading waiting even a single month, and you waited 10. I remember you wrote on a bench in our old classroom - "December 2, Finally alive again". That's exactly what ill feel now. Omg were literally us ☺️</h3>
        <br>
        <h3>They say if you truly love someone, then let them go. But if you truly someone, why would you let them go? Why would you not do everything in your power to never have to start over again. The world tells you to move on, thats its just a relationship - but why would I? It was never just a relationship to me, it was the most beautiful and real thing I've ever experienced. You were my entire world, baby. And I'm not giving up on that. Because I truly love you, I will never let you go. Because I truly love you, I will never stop fighting, I will never stop feeling. I love you.</h3>

        <h3>How do I wait so long to reach out to you? Everyday it hurts more and more without you. I just want to talk to you. And you seem happy. I don't know if there's something else going on behind. I know to everyone else, I seem happy and unbothered too - but only I know how much I miss you. I miss you lasya. Each day I resist the urge to reach out to you - knowing you need space. The thing is, waiting wouldn't be as hard if I knew you were walking to me, or even thinking about walking to me. But I don't know. Not knowing is the worst part. Despite everything, I'll still love you. I love you lasya.</h3>
