      <h2 id="hintText" style="color: teal;">Hi Lasya, (Don't worry, it gets much more colourful after this)</h2>
      <h2 id="add_pad" style="color: teal;">A little disclaimer:</h2>
      <p>A little clarification about what you've heard about me. I saw the things jadam said about me. And genuinely - wtf? How does someone twist something so much? Yes I talked to that girl, but lasya do you know what I talked to her about? You. About missing you, about still liking you - because literally everyone who knows me knows you too - even the people I barely know. And the thing about spamming her with reels and talking to her when my friend broke up? I sent her reels about you; about missing you, lasya - and not once have I spoken badly things about you; they were the same things i wish i could tell you. And the thing jadam told about me "becoming besties" with her? I was the one convincing her and my friend to talk to one another again - to give each other another chance. I was the one who brought them back together. You can ask either of them yourself, lasya - i even have screenshots if you need them. I have loved you for so long - and I'm not the type of person who goes around meddling in my friends relationships just to hope to have a fraction of what we had. And I genuinely don't get how she's calling me "Deeksha whore" - because I do not talk to anyone else except my gay ahh niggas (btw dishan pradeep is gay for me ðŸ™„) - literally everyone else talks to the girls in my class and im the one waiting on the side for them to finish. And you know what jadam comes and tells my friend in class? "Bro lasya was talking shit about swaroop but I have <i>no</i> idea why" - when shes literally the one who said all that about me? Genuinely, what the fuck? She calls me a whore - but talks to every single boy in college in such a flirty way while having a bf, and then even chases around some hot teacher around the entire campus while saying "he's too hot I can't stand it". And shes also going around telling people that i apparently played football till i went numb in the legs and cried on the turf? I literally have no idea what all that is about - ive only had my regular "broken foot" every now and then. Gurl what is she genuinely trying to do? Anyways, I'm sorry about the rant - I just wanted to make sure you knew the truth. I get why you said those things about me, and I don't blame you - maybe I would've had a similiar reaction. I'm sorry that this website got off on the wrong note - but I really don't want you to think about me that way - especially when I didn't do any of those things. I hope the rest of the webiste is good, <i>I spent over 60 hours on it and it's all for you</i></p>

      <p>I hope you like it :)</p>
